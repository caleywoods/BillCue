BillCue
=======

BillCue is a calendar app done in rails 3. It uses devise for
authentication, devise_invitable to allow invitations, haml for
templating, and rspec/autotest for unit tests.

It will first support email reminders but should quickly integrate
sms reminders using Twilio and then expand again to support tweets and
DM's.
